<br>
<p>(Translated from Japanese) "Kevonz Island is such an addictive game that once played, will certainly make you wanna play it again and again. Escape a virtual island full of puzzles, mazes and GSL followers who will harm you on sight. This has motivated me to create my own, similarly themed and brand new game that is also set on an island but with much more scary elements." - Nohito, creator and developer of Lomando.com</p>
<br>
<p>"Kevonz Island definitely overused JavaScript, still, it's a great game! You get to avoid or fight certain enemies, all powered with the legendary HTML, CSS and JS. Releasing the source code helps curious gamers know how the game works and realize it's not some "otherworldly" magic, but rather the kind of magic created using programming languages." - Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla Foundation</p>
<br>
<p>"What the fuck is this bullshit? Where are the 3D blocky elements?" - Dream, former Minecraft YouTuber turned pedophilic VTuber</p>
<br>
<p>"Kevonz Island demonstrates how dangerous it is to be on a strange and forgotten island" - Jeffrey Epstein (1953-2019), American financier, island owner and former teacher</p>
<br>
<p>"This game's storyline needs to be expanded. I've finished this glowie in under 10 minutes. Boring piece of shit" - Terry A. Davis (1969-2018), creator of TempleOS, engineer and gifted computer programmer</p>
